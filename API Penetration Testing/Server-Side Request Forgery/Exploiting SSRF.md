Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability that takes place when an application retrieves remote resources without validating user input. An attacker can supply their own input, in the form of a URL, to control the remote resources that are retrieved by the targeted server. When you have control over what resources a server requests then you can gain access to sensitive data or worse completely compromise a vulnerable host. SSRF is number 10 on the 2021 OWASP Top 10 list and is a growing threat to APIs.

## SSRF Impact
- The attacker could supply URLs that expose private data
- scan the target's internal network
- compromise the target through remote code execution

To drive the point home check out the bug bounty rewards for SSRF guidelines on Facebook ([https://m.facebook.com/whitehat/payout_guidelines/ssrf/](https://m.facebook.com/whitehat/payout_guidelines/ssrf/)):
### Payouts

- $40,000 - SSRF in production and reading the response (must include canary in your report)
- $30,000 - Blind SSRF in production and **not** reading the response (must trigger the canary alert)
- $10,000 - Hitting arbitrary endpoints within a corporate network (e.g. through an unpatched CVE on a third-party system)
- $1,000 - If you can only hit a small number of endpoints within the corporate network (e.g. a small set of hosts or loopback only)

## Types of SSRF
**In Band SSRF**, means that the server responds with the resources specified by the end user. If the attacker specifies the payload as [http://google.com](http://google.com) to a server with an In-Band SSRF vulnerability the server would make the request and respond to the attacker with information served from google.com

**Blind SSRF** takes place when the attacker supplies a URL and the server makes the request but does not send information from the specified URL back to the attacker. In the case of Blind SSRF, you would need a web server that will capture the request from the target to prove that you forced the server to make the request.
