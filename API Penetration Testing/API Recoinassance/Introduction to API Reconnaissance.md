Be on the lookout for obvious URL naming schemes:

https://target-name.com/api/v1 

https://api.target-name.com/v1 

https://target-name.com/docs

https://dev.target-name.com/rest

Look for API indicators within directory names like:
/api, /api/v1, /v1, /v2, /v3, /rest, /swagger, /swagger.json, /doc, /docs, /graphql, /graphiql, /altair, /playground

Also, subdomains can also be indicators of web APIs:

api.target-name.com

uat.target-name.com

dev.target-name.com

developer.target-name.com

test.target-name.com

Another indicator of web APIs is the HTTP request and response headers. The use of JSON or XML can be a good indicator that you have discovered an API. 

HTTP Request and Response Headers containing "Content-Type: application/json, application/xml"

 

Also, watch for HTTP Responses that include statements like:
{"message": "Missing Authorization token"}

 

One of the most obvious indicators of an API would be through information gathered using third-Party Sources like Github and API directories.
