An API must have requests that accept user input, these requests must be able to alter values not available to the user, and the API must be missing security controls that would otherwise prevent the user input from altering data objects. The classic example of a mass assignment is when an attacker is able to add parameters to the user registration process that escalate their account from a basic user to an administrator. The user registration request may contain key-values for username, email address, and password. An attacker could intercept this request and add parameters like "isadmin": "true". If the data object has a corresponding value and the API provider does not sanitize the attacker's input then there is a chance that the attacker could register their own admin account.

Look for parameters involved in user account properties, critical functions, and administrative actions.
