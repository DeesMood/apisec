And this is where we'll introduce the three pillars of API security, governance, monitoring, and testing. And we'll dig into each one of these individually.

But at a high level, governance is all about defining and establishing and enforcing standard processes for developing APIs, testing APIs, getting them into production in a secure and consistent way.

Monitoring is about runtime protection. Protecting our APIs in production, making sure they are behaving as expected.

Testing is all about making sure your APIs are free of vulnerabilities, that they perform as expected. And there aren't any flaws that can be exploited.
