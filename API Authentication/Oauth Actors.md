The resource server is the API. The resource owner is the user. So I have an account at Yahoo.

Obviously, I have data in the Yahoo servers, which are exposed by the Yahoo APIs. So Yahoo, in that case, would be the resource server, and I would be the resource owner. But, I now downloaded a third party application or I visited a third party website and I want that to reach my content at the resource server.

This is called a client. And the client then needs to be delegated access so that it can talk to the resource server on my behalf. And in order to do the client is authorized by the authorization server, this delegated access.
