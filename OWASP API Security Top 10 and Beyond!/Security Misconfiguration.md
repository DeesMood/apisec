API8:2023 Security Misconfiguration represents a catch-all for many vulnerabilities related to the systems that host APIs. The impacts of an exploited security misconfiguration can range from information disclosure to data breach.

## [OWASP Attack Vector Description](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa8-security-misconfiguration/)

_Attackers will often attempt to find unpatched flaws, common endpoints, or unprotected files and directories to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system._

## [OWASP Security Weakness Description](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa8-security-misconfiguration/)

_Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of the API stack, from the network level to the application level. Automated tools are available to detect and exploit misconfigurations such as unnecessary services or legacy options._

## [OWASP Impacts Description](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa8-security-misconfiguration/)

_Security misconfigurations can not only expose sensitive user data, but also system details that can lead to full server compromise._

## Summary

The X-Powered-By header reveals backend technology. Headers like this one will often advertise the exact supporting service and its version. You could use information like this to search for exploits published for that version of software.

X-XSS-Protection is exactly what it looks like: a header meant to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS is a common type of injection vulnerability where an attacker could insert scripts into a web page and trick end-users into clicking on malicious links. An X-XSS-Protection value of 0 indicates no protections in place and a value of 1 indicates that the protection is turned on. This header, and others like it, clearly reveals whether or not a security control is in place.

The X-Response-Time header is middleware that provides usage metrics. In the previous example, its value represents 566.43 milliseconds. But if the API isn’t configured properly, this header can function as a side-channel used to reveal existing resources. If the X-Response-Time header has a consistent response time for non-existing records, for example, but increases its response time for certain other records, this could be an indication that those records exist.
Say, for instance, an attacker can determine that a bogus account like /user/account/thisdefinitelydoesnotexist has an average X-Response-Time of 25.5 ms. You also know that your existing account /user/account/1021 receives an X-Response-Time of 510.00. An attacker could then send requests brute forcing account numbers and review the results and see which account numbers resulted in drastically increased response times.

Lastly, if an API provider allows unnecessary HTTP methods, there is an increased risk that the application won’t handle these methods properly or will result in sensitive information disclosure.

## [OWASP Preventative Measures](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa8-security-misconfiguration/)

_The API life cycle should include:_

- _A repeatable hardening process leading to fast and easy deployment of a properly locked down environment_
- _A task to review and update configurations across the entire API stack. The review should include: orchestration files, API components, and cloud services (e.g. S3 bucket permissions)_
- _An automated process to continuously assess the effectiveness of the configuration and settings in all environments_

_Furthermore:_

- _Ensure that all API communications from the client to the API server and any downstream/upstream components happen over an encrypted communication channel (TLS), regardless of whether it is an internal or public-facing API._
- _Be specific about which HTTP verbs each API can be accessed by: all other HTTP verbs should be disabled (e.g. HEAD)._
- _APIs expecting to be accessed from browser-based clients (e.g., WebApp front-end) should, at least:_
    - _implement a proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy_
    - _include applicable Security Headers_
- _Restrict incoming content types/data formats to those that meet the business/ functional requirements._
- _Ensure all servers in the HTTP server chain (e.g. load balancers, reverse and forward proxies, and back-end servers) process incoming requests in a uniform manner to avoid desync issues._
- _Where applicable, define and enforce all API response payload schemas, including error responses, to prevent exception traces and other valuable information from being sent back to attackers._
